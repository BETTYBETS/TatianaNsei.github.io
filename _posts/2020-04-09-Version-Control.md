Also known as revision control or source control, version Controls is all about the management of changes to documents, 
large websites, computer programs and other collections of information. Version control is a system that records changes 
to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
 
It lets you track your files over time, So incase you mess up you can easily get back to a previous working version.
